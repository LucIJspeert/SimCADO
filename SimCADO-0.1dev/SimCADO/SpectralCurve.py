# SpectralCurve
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
# "If you pay peanuts, you get monkeys"
#
# A SpectralCurve is the base class for either a transmission curve or an 
# emission curve. The main attributes are 2 equal length arrays holding the 
# centres of each wavelength bin and the corresponding value - an energy or a 
# transmission factor [0-1]
#  - lam
#  - val 
#
# SpectralCurve should be overloaded on the + and * operators. Although a rebin
# method would be good, this is unique to the subclasses. E.g. a 
# TransmissionCurve rebin would involve averaging the "val" values, while a
# SpectralCurve rebin would involve summing up the "val" values.
# 
# SpectralCurve also needs the file path of the data:
#  - filename
#
# A TransmissionCurve doesn't need anything else on top of the SpectralCurve,
# however the EmissionCurve must know which units are being used so that it
# can immediately convert the energy into photons. In order to do this the 
# EmissionCurve needs the following extra info from the UserCommands dictionary
#  - spatial area [m2]
#  - angular area [arcsec2]
#  - integration time [s]
#
# As stated above each subclass should have its own rebin(lam_res) method 
#
# Notes:
# All wavelength values are in [Âµm]
# All other values are either transmission [0-1] or number of photons [>=0]
#
# Classes:
#  SpectralCurve(object) 
#  - from_file(filename)
#  - from_list([ThroughputCurve])
#  - from_skycalc(filename)
#
# Subclasses:
# Emission(SpectralCurve)
# - rebin(lam)
# Throughput(SpectralCurve)
# - rebin(lam)
#
# Methods:
