# SimCADO Workshop
University of Vienna  
[Department of Astrophysics](https://astro.univie.ac.at/en/home/)
      
Start:  13:00, 16th February, 2017  
End:    14:00, 17th February, 2017

## Summary

A **very** hands-on and informal workshop for using SimCADO to simulate science images with MICADO. The primary audience are the MICADO and MAORY science teams, however anybody who wishes to learn the basics of SimCADO is welcome to attend. However, each participant **MUST** bring their own science case (and the relevant data to attack it) to the workshop (more on this below). Python 3 is the language of SimCADO and therefore also the language of the workshop.

**Please read the [Prerequisits and Preparation](#prerequisits-and-preparation) section if you plan on attending**

## Format: Hack-a-thon

The primary goal of this workshop is to get people comfortable using SimCADO on their own so that they can continue developing and investigating their own science cases with SimCADO after the workshop. As such, the workshop will be run in the style of a hack-a-thon: small groups programming together and helping each other to get the most out of the software - similar to the dot-Astronomy and SPIE Hack-Days.

We will begin with a 1-2 hour introduction to the finer points of SimCADO and work through a series of examples. Then everyone will split into groups and begin pushing their own science cases through SimCADO. Oliver and I will move from group to group helping where we can and giving ideas on how best to attack the different science cases with SimCADO. 

It must be stressed that this is a **very informal** meeting. There is little in the way of an official programme and coffee breaks can be taken whenever.

## Prerequisits and Preparation


To participate in this workshop, you will need the following:

* a laptop (preferably with 8GB of RAM) with:
    * Python 3
    * Numpy, Scipy, Astropy, SimCADO
        * optional: Matplotlib, Poppy, PySynPhot, photutils
* a science case idea
* data for your science case
    * Spatial information. Any one of the following:
        * e.g. an image (FITS or otherwise) for extended source
        * or brightness profile and object dimensions
        * or list of (x,y) coordinates for point sources
    * Spectral information. Any one of the following:
        * e.g. Spectrum/Spectra for various objects
        * or Photometric information: Magnitudes, colours, surface brightness
        * or Fluxes (preferably in ph/s/m2/nm, i.e. F_lambda)

        
Please make sure you have a science case and the data to attack it. While spectators are welcome to attend, the primary reason for this "work"-shop is to work. Therefore to get the most out of the time, please **prepare your data and your laptop** before arriving.

A series of tutorials and worked examples will be posted on the SimCADO website in the coming weeks. It will be advantageous to look through these before the workshop begins.
