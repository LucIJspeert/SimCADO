# Notebooks

Here are a list of notebooks detailing how to use SimCADO. If you would like to add a notebook to this collection, please email it to [Kieran Leschinski](kieran.leschinski@univie.ac.at).

## Tutorials
* [my_first_sim.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/www.univie.ac.at/simcado/examples/my_first_sim.ipynb)
  An introductory notebook to SimCADO. Topics include: first steps with SimCADO, creating ``Source`` objects and customising simulations.

## Science Cases  
* [Betelgeuse.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/www.univie.ac.at/simcado/examples/Betelgeuse.ipynb)
  A quick look at whether it would be possible to observe Betelgeuse (J = -3 mag) with SimCADO without destroying the detectors. Short answer: yes.

## MICADO experiments  
* [E-ELT_2-Phase_Mirror.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/www.univie.ac.at/simcado/examples/POPPY_EELT.ipynb)
  As the primary mirror of the E-ELT may be built in 2 phases, this notebook uses SimCADO to have a look at what that means for the resulting E-ELT PSF. **Note** the PSFs generated here are only approximations based on a diffraction limited core combined with a Seeing Halo. These are meant only as a guide.
