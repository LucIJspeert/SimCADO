# Notebooks

Here are a list of notebooks detailing how to use SimCADO. If you would like to add a notebook to this collection, please email it to [Kieran Leschinski](kieran.leschinski@univie.ac.at).

## Tutorials
* [my_first_sim.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/www.univie.ac.at/simcado/examples/my_first_sim.ipynb)  
  An introductory notebook to SimCADO. Topics include: first steps with SimCADO, creating ``Source`` objects and customising simulations.

## Science Cases  
* [Betelgeuse.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/www.univie.ac.at/simcado/examples/Betelgeuse.ipynb)  
  A quick look at whether it would be possible to observe Betelgeuse (J = -3 mag) with SimCADO without destroying the detectors. Short answer: yes.
* [StarDestroyer.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/www.univie.ac.at/simcado/examples/StarDestroyer.ipynb)  
  If General Tarkin were to attack Earth and has hidding in orbit around the moon in his spaceship, could the E-ELT see it, and would we we know what it was?

## MICADO experiments  
* [E-ELT_2-Phase_Mirror.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/www.univie.ac.at/simcado/examples/POPPY_EELT.ipynb)  
  As the primary mirror of the E-ELT may be built in 2 phases, this notebook uses SimCADO to have a look at what that means for the resulting E-ELT PSF. **Note** the PSFs generated here are only approximations based on a diffraction limited core combined with a Seeing Halo. These are meant only as a guide.
* [Filter_Wings.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/www.univie.ac.at/simcado/examples/Filter_Wings.ipynb)  
  A experiment to investigate the transmission coefficients that the filters in MICADO will need to have in order to restrict flux leakage through the filter wings to less than 1% of the flux coming through the filter. 
  
## Workshop notebooks
1. [Setting up SimCADO](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/www.univie.ac.at/simcado/examples/1_Setting_up_SimCADO.ipynb)  
   Some basics about running SimCADO
2. [Working with point sources](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/www.univie.ac.at/simcado/examples/2_Working_with_Point_Sources.ipynb)  
   The basics for making and combining point source objects
* [Working with extended sources]()
* [Working with multiple sources]()
* [Running simulations]()
* [Astrometry]
