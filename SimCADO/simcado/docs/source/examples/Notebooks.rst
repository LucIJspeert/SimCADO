Notebooks
=========

Here are a list of notebooks detailing how to use SimCADO. If you would
like to add a notebook to this collection, please email it to `Kieran
Leschinski`_.

Tutorials
---------

-  `my\_first\_sim.ipynb`_
   An introductory notebook to SimCADO. Topics include: first steps with
   SimCADO, creating ``Source`` objects and customising simulations.

Science Cases
-------------

-  `Betelgeuse.ipynb`_
   A quick look at whether it would be possible to observe Betelgeuse (J
   = -3 mag) with SimCADO without destroying the detectors. Short
   answer: yes.
-  `StarDestroyer.ipynb`_
   If General Tarkin were to attack Earth and has hidding in orbit
   around the moon in his spaceship, could the E-ELT see it, and would
   we we know what it was?

MICADO experiments
------------------

-  `E-ELT\_2-Phase\_Mirror.ipynb`_
   As the primary mirror of the E-ELT may be built in 2 phases, this
   notebook uses SimCADO to have a look at what that means for the
   resulting E-ELT PSF.

.. note::
    the PSFs generated here are only approximations based on a diffraction limited core combined with a Seeing Halo. These are meant only as a guide.

-  `Filter\_Wings.ipynb`_
   A experiment to investigate the transmission coefficients that the
   filters in MICADO will need to have in order to restrict flux leakage
   through the filter wings to less than 1% of the flux coming through
   the filter.

Workshop notebooks
------------------

#. `Setting up SimCADO`_
