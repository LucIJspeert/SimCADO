## Python 3 vs Python 2
**SimCADO has been programmed in Python 3.**

While most of the basic functionality for SimCADO will work with Python 2.7, we haven't tested it properly. For example, the function `simcado.install_noise_cube()` only works in Python 3. This isn't critical - it just means that if you want to have read noise variations in your images, you need to use Python 3. However it won't crash SimCADO for single images.

See the [Features](Features) for a list of the "known" issues when running in Python 2.7

**A side note**: Astropy will stop supporting Python 2.7 in 2019 and the official End-of-Life for Python 2.7 is 2020, i.e. no more maintainance. We are running under the assumption that SimCADO will (hopefully) still be around after 2020, hence why we have concentrated our efforts on developing in Python 3.

## Installation
â€‹
To install it, download SimCADO from the link above and use the standard `pip3` call to install it:

`$ pip3 install --user SimCADO.zip`

Alternatively give the full URL to pip and let it do the downloading for you

`$ pip3 install --user http://www.univie.ac.at/simcado/SimCADO.zip`

**Note** that SimCADO will need to download several hundreds of MBs of instrument data into the install directory. Hence why we use the `--user` flag when installing via `pip`. If you want to keep SimCADO in your normal packages directory, then you will need to give python root access while updating SimCADO's data files.

## Getting up-to-date data for SimCADO

SimCADO is being developed along side MICADO. To keep the files that SimCADO uses as fresh as possible, you should run the following command, at the very least **the first time you start SimCADO** 

	>>> import simcado
	>>> simcado.get_extras()

This downloads the latest versions of all the files SimCADO uses behind the scenes, e.g. PSF files, transmission curves etc. If you haven't used SimCADO for several months, chances are there are new data available. It is therefore advantageous to run this command periodically.

## Adding variation to the Detector noise

**Currently only available for Python 3.**

By default SimCADO only supplies a single H4RG noise frame. Hence if you plan on generating a series of images, all images will have the same *detector noise* pattern. Don't worry, photon shot noise is still completely random, however if you stack 1000s of simulated images with the same detector noise frame, this pattern will show through. This problem can be avoided by running the following function the first time you run simcado:

**We recommend running this command in a seperate Python session** as it can take up to 10 minutes depending on your computer.

    >>> simcado.install_noise_cube(n=25)
   
SimCADO contains the code to generate unique detector noise images ([Rauscher 2015](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PASP..127.1144R)), however creating a 4k detector noise frame takes about 20 seconds. In order to avoid wasting time by generating noise for each frame every time SimCADO is run, `.install_noise_cube(n)` generates `n` noise frames and saves them in the SimCADO data directory. In future simulation one of these detector noise frames are picked at random whenever a `<Detector>.read_out()` is called. 

Obviously a trade-off has to be made when running `.install_noise_cube(n)`. The more noise frames available, the less systematic noise is visible in the read noise of stacked images. However, the more frames are generated, the longer it takes. A good solution is to open a seperate window and have SimCADO generate frames in the background.
