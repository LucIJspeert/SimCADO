    This is the lightcurve that follows the shape of the Crab Pulsar, but
    scaled so that each pulse is easily visible in a 5ms windowed H-band
    exposure with MICADO. The star is H=15mag. The light curve has been
    extracted from the intermediate non-destructive reads from an up-the-ramp
    simulated exposure.

    Omega Cen as imaged with HST/WFC3, HST/SimCADO and MICADO/SimCADO by
    Maximilian Fabricius (MPE). The synthetic images
    of the same region of Omega Cen are based on the HST catalog by
    Anderson & van der Marel 2010 and augmented by all the faint stars
    that did not end up in the HST catalogue.

    A galaxy field based on B, R and Halpha images of the Antennae galaxy
    generated with SimCADO as a proof of concept. The image includes all ways of
    generating input for SimCADO: importing intensity maps from real (HST)
    images, generating galaxies based on a sersic profile in memory, and basic
    stars as point sources with spectra from the Pickles (1998) catalogue. The
    code to generate this image can be found in the
    :doc:`Notebooks <6_Notebooks>` section.
